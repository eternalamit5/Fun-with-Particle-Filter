# Fun-with-Particle-Filter

- In this code, The  Nation's Army Jet has just run into the mysterious Enemy Jet.
The Enemy Jet was just doing it's typical magical Enemy Jet stuff
throughout the sky.

- The Nation Army Jet, knowing the impossible agility of the Enemy Jet, began to
stretch out and prepare for attack.  During which the Enemy Jet mediated and
generated a highly non-linear flight model with strong illusions (i.e. weird measurements :P) and takes off!

- The Nation Army Jet's make chase but, only knowing linear algorithms, they
fail very quickly.  However, the Air Force Chief of the Army knows the
particle filter, and after a cognitively and physical exhaustive, epic
chase, the Air Force Chief catches the Enemy Jet, and takes it back to their secret base.

- Here, we learn this Air Force Chief skill, known as the particle filter, as applied
to a highly nonlinear model. :)!

- Particle is generated using Monte Carlo Distrubution
- Weight Update equation follows Gausian Distribution
